⚠️ [before interact with me]


- i can be quiet sensitive if your jokes went too far and i could possibly block you permanently without mercy.
- do NOT ragebait in front of me because i will hide you/block you permanently too.
- please do NOT bring something personal to me unless we are very close or you're my pinned friends.
- if you want to vent to me, i say don't. i dont accept vents from random people who aren't in my friendlist or i don't know them SO WELL.
- mainly ships: cool7n7[NOT FORSAKEN], paycheck, pizzapunch, Johnjane, 1xdoe, doublefedora, daisy1337, moonberry, or even silentlily ['ll respect your ships if you tell me but if it's NOT PROSH1P.]
- if you DONT LIKE my ships, i suggest you hide me or block. Because I won't deal with fighting over ships with you.
