[Temporary]

🟢: free, allowed to cuds and int with me.


🌙: sleeping, watching movies, cuddle still allowed, rarely talk(except with friends).


⛔: drawing, afk, no respond(except friends), but just whisper me still to interact, cuddle is NOT allowed except friends.


---

⚠️ [before interact with me]

- i can be quiet sensitive if your jokes went too far and i could possibly block you permanently without mercy.
- do NOT ragebait in front of me because i will hide you/block you permanently too.
- please do NOT bring something personal to me unless we are very close or you're my pinned friends.
- if you want to vent to me, i say don't. i dont accept vents from random people who aren't in my friendlist or i don't know them SO WELL.

  - mainly ships: cool7n7[NOT FORSAKEN], paycheck, pizzapunch, Johnjane, 1xdoe, doublefedora, daisy1337, and guestnoob.
[I'll respect your ships if you tell me but if it's NOT PROSH1P.]

- I can be quiet aggressive and rude if you test my patience, so don't play with me unless you're joking.
- if you DONT LIKE my ships, i suggest you hide me or block. Because I won't deal with fighting over ships at you.

[I ship cool7n7 BUT DO NOT INTERACT IF YOU ALTHOUGH IT'S FORSAKEN. I HAVE WROTE **'NOT FORSAKEN'** ]
